# Exercise 1: Tasks in lecture notes

**Task 1**: Perform the Sammon mapping on the `crimes` dataset using the command `sammon` from the `MASS` library and comment on the scatterplot.

`r hide("Hint")`
The `crimes` dataset contains correlation between seven crime types, and therefore, the first step is to convert the correlation matrix into the dissimilarity matrix by using `sim2dist(crimes, method="corr")`. 

After performing sammon mapping, configuration points are stored `$points`. 
`r unhide()`
